# Performance Monitor

A lightweight macOS menu bar app that gives you real-time system metrics at a glance — CPU, memory, network, disk, GPU, battery, and Bluetooth, all in a clean popover interface.

## Requirements

- **Apple Silicon (M1 or later)** — this build is arm64-only and will not run on Intel Macs
- **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later**

---

## What's new in v1.0.0

- **Signed auto-updates** — in-app updates are cryptographically verified (Ed25519) before installation
- **Beta channel** — separate "Performance Monitor Beta" app for testing pre-releases alongside the stable app
- **Lighter footprint** — process sampling only runs while visible; all system reads off the main thread
- **First-run onboarding, VoiceOver support, and local (never uploaded) crash reports**

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full version history.

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask inequitas/tap/performance-monitor
```

> **Gatekeeper note:** The app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID). On first launch, right-click the app → **Open** to bypass the unidentified developer warning.

### Manual

1. Download the latest `Performance Monitor.app` from [Releases](https://github.com/inequitas/performancemonitor/releases)
2. Unzip and drag to `/Applications`
3. Launch — the app appears in your menu bar
4. Grant **Bluetooth** permission when prompted to see Bluetooth device info

> **Gatekeeper note:** The app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID). On first launch, right-click the app → **Open** to bypass the unidentified developer warning.

## Beta releases

Beta builds let early testers try upcoming changes before they reach the stable channel.

- **Workflow:** new features are developed on the `beta` branch (branched from `main`). Beta builds are tagged `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` (e.g. `v1.1.0-beta.1`) and published as GitHub **pre-releases**. Stable releases are still tagged `vX.Y.Z` from `main`, as before.
- **Building a beta:** `bash build_app.sh --beta` produces "Performance Monitor Beta" with its own bundle ID (`com.performancemonitor.beta`, so its settings are separate from the stable app) and a badged icon. `scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z-beta.N --beta [--publish]` builds, tags, and publishes it as a pre-release.
- **Update channel:** each build embeds a `PMUpdateChannel` key (`stable` or `beta`) in its `Info.plist`. Stable installs only ever see stable releases (GitHub's "latest" endpoint never returns a pre-release). Beta installs check the full releases list and are offered the newest version — beta or stable — so a beta install eventually rolls onto the corresponding stable release once one ships. The channel is shown in Settings → Updates when running the beta build.

## Building from Source

Requires an Apple Silicon Mac, Xcode Command Line Tools, and Swift 5.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inequitas/performancemonitor.git
cd performancemonitor
bash build_app.sh
open ".build/bundle/Performance Monitor.app"
```

The build script compiles a release binary, assembles the `.app` bundle (under the hidden `.build/bundle/`, so Spotlight doesn't index it), embeds the icon, injects the version from `VERSION`, and applies an ad-hoc code signature. Only the signed `.zip` for distribution is written to `dist/`. Pass `--beta` to build the beta-channel variant instead.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| Bluetooth | Read paired device names and battery levels |

No data is collected or transmitted. Everything runs locally.

---

## Support

Performance Monitor is free and will stay free — no paywalled features, ever.
If it saves you the price of a paid alternative, consider [sponsoring on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/inequitas); it helps cover Apple's Developer Program fee so the app can be notarised. A ⭐ on the repo helps too. Supporters are listed in [SUPPORTERS.md](SUPPORTERS.md).

### Menu Bar
- Configurable metric: CPU, Memory, Network, or Disk
- Two display styles: **Sparkline** (mini live chart + current value) or **Text only**
- Sparkline shows the last 30 seconds of history, updated every second

### Thermal & Fans
- CPU, GPU, and Battery temperatures read from the SMC via IOKit — works across all Apple Silicon (M1–M4)
- All three temperatures shown on the main overview card, colour-coded green → yellow → orange → red
- **Extended sensor detail** in the Thermal view: individual CPU cores, GPU clusters, Trackpad, Storage, Memory, and System board sensors
- Grouped rows with expandable chevrons — tap to see individual core or cluster readings
- System group (Trackpad, WiFi/Airport proximity, Charger) shown expanded by default
- Fan speeds (Left/Right) with min/max range, position bar, and intake airflow temperature
- System thermal pressure level (Nominal → Critical)

## Tech Stack

- **Swift / SwiftUI** — UI and app lifecycle
- **IOKit** — CPU, disk, battery, and HID device metrics
- **CoreWLAN** — Wi-Fi signal strength
- **IOBluetooth** — Paired Bluetooth device list
- **CoreBluetooth** — BLE GATT Battery Service reads
- **Swift Package Manager** — No Xcode project required
